Photograph: Dado RuviÄ/ReutersArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 2 months oldAI race heats up as OpenAI, Google and Mistral release new modelsThis article is more than 2 months oldLaunches within 12 hours of one another, and more activity expected in industry over summerAlex Hern UK technology editorWed 10 Apr 2024 13.56 CESTLast modified on Thu 11 Apr 2024 03.31 CESTShareOpenAI, Google, and the French artificial intelligence startup Mistral have all released new versions of their frontier AI models within 12 hours of one another, as the industry prepares for a burst of activity over the summer.The unprecedented flurry of releases come as the sector readies for the expected launch of the next major version of GPT, the system that underpins OpenAIâs hit chatbot Chat-GPT.The first came only hours after Nick Clegg appeared on stage at an event in London, where he confirmed reports that the third version of Metaâs own AI model, Llama, would be published in a matter of weeks.Elon Musk predicts superhuman AI will be smarter than people next yearRead moreSeven hours after Clegg left the stage, Googleâs Gemini Pro 1.5, his competitorâs most advanced large language model, was released to the general public, with a free tier limited to 50 requests a day.An hour later, OpenAI released its own frontier model, the final version of GPT-4 Turbo. GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini Pro 1.5 are âmultimodalâ systems, able to accept more than just text. Each can take image input, while Gemini can also accept audio and video.In the early hours of the morning in France, Mistral, an AI startup founded by a number of Cleggâs former colleagues in Metaâs AI team, released its frontier model, Mixtral 8x22B. Unlike its two American competitors, Mixtral was released through a simple download link to a 281GB file: the company, like Meta, takes an âopen sourceâ approach, and publishes its AI systems free for anyone to download and build upon.That approach has been criticised as potentially dangerous, since it leaves the developer unable to intervene and stop its systems being used for harmful ends, nor to pull models offline if vulnerabilities or biases are discovered and need to be fixed. Others, including Meta, defend it as ultimately leading to better outcomes than systems âkept in the clammy hands of a small number of very, very large, well-heeled companies in Californiaâ.Metaâs Llama 3 is expected to be released initially in its smaller, less powerful versions, according to a report from The Information, building up to a release of the companyâs most advanced frontier model this summer. However, it may face stiff competition: OpenAI is believed to be planning a similar timeframe for its next GPT model, GPT-5, with the companyâs chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap, telling the Financial Times it would be coming âsoonâ.However, experts have queried whether the âlarge language modelâ approach shared by all frontier AI systems might be hitting its limits. âWe hear a lot of people saying: âOh my God, weâre going to get [artificial general intelligence] within the next year,â said Metaâs chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, responding to a claim from the xAI founder, Elon Musk. âItâs just not happening. We have AI systems that can pass the bar exam, but they canât clear up your dinner table and fill up the dishwasher. We have systems that manipulate language, and fool us into thinking that they are smart, but cannot understand the world.âskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day â we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That âis more of a vision than anything elseâ, he added, âbut itâs making exponential progress, so Iâm pretty confident that weâll get thereâ.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Technology sectorOpenAIGoogleMetaNick CleggFrancenewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyAI\\xa0will be help rather than hindrance in hitting climate targets, Bill Gates says2d agoResearchers fool university markers with AI-generated exam papers3d agoUK\\xa0needs system for recording AI misuse and malfunctions, thinktank says3d agoAre\\xa0you 80% angry and 2% sad?
